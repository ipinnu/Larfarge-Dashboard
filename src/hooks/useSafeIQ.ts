Aggressive following distances combined with a declining safety trend (11 incidents in 30 days) indicate a persistent behavioural pattern rather than an isolated lapse. The maintenance gap since December 2024 raises an additional concern about brake pad wear, which compounds stopping distance on a vehicle already operating in high-risk conditions.',

In isolation, this event sits against a stable trend and a score of 71, suggesting a momentary lapse in attentiveness rather than a chronic unsafe driving pattern. Clear weather and moderate traffic removed environmental complexity, making this a behavioural rather than situational incident and therefore responsive to standard coaching intervention.',

Kelechi Nwosu\'s safety score of 88 and improving trend confirm this is a high-performing driver whose behaviour does not raise concern. The primary fleet exposure here is fuel efficiency and engine wear from idling, not safety risk — the issue sits with scheduling and gate access optimisation, not driver conduct.',
